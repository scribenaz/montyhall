Description: The game setup replicates the door game on the old TV game show "Let's
   Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of 
   which has a car behind it and two doors have goats. The contestant selects a door, 
   then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an 
   opportunity to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened 
   door. The code generated by this package will run 10,000 simulations and record the
   outcome of each simulation to make inferences on the outcome and the contestant's 
   propability of Winning or Losing based upon their strategy of Staying or Switching
   doors in hopes of winning the car.
